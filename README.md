Analysis of Google jobs data from SerpAPI

#### -- Project Status: [In process]

## Project Intro/Objective
This project is dual purposed; one to help me hone and develope my new skills in extracting data from APIs, data analyzation using natural language processing and data vizualization. The second purpose being to help me more effeciently search for jobs that might be a good match to those skills. 


### Methods Used
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization


### Technologies
* Google jobs API 
* Python
* Pandas
* MatPlotLib
* NLTK

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to practice my developing data skills which I hope will land me a job, on a dataset that will be helpful in finding me a job! 

The first step of the project was to develop a repeatable and easily modifiable script to pull current job listings from the SerpAPI Google jobs and listings APIs. The first API call is nested in a function taking the desired job title as an arguement. I designed the code as a function so I could easily search for different titles and pull those to a data frame. The script then uses the job id data pulled from the first call to pulling in listing specific information. 

Then to use Python's Natural Language Tool Kit along with Pandas methods and functions to make navigating and following up on those job listings quick and efficient.

   (Provide more detailed overview of the project.  Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and     hypothesis you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to       solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing?  Feel free to number or bullet point things    here)

## Needs of this project

- frontend developers
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
