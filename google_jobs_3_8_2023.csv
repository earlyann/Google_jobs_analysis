Senior Data Analyst,Vouch,"About Vouch:

Insurance... sounds slow, old-fashioned, and unexciting. Exactly. Insurance is broken, and it's failing fast-moving, innovative startups...

Vouch is a new, technology-first insurance company backed with $160M in funding from world-class investors. Like Stripe for payments or Brex for credit cards, Vouch is creating the go-to business insurance for high-growth companies.

We're doing this by making insurance fast, responsive, and focused on our customers -high growth and innovative companies. Instead of printed PDF applications and week-long waits, Vouch is building new technology to solve real problems, writing policies that actually cover relevant startup scenarios, and designing simple experiences in an otherwise frustrating industry.

What does a work environment look like at Vouch?

Vouch is a Virtual First Workplace with office locations in SF, Chicago, and NYC . This role can be based anywhere in the U.S as long as you can work our Vouch core collaboration hours (8:30 am-2:30 pm Pacific Time.)

Role Responsibilities:

As an insurance company, data is at the core of everything we do at Vouch. Data and analysis are critical to improving insurance design, underwriting, and outcomes for our clients. Data also drives our business operations and our financial decisions. As a Data Analyst at Vouch, you’ll have the unique opportunity to build the foundational data structure, tools, and models to help all of our functions become increasingly data-driven. You will be part of the Analytics team and sit cross-functionally working closely with the data team, finance, biz ops and product managers that work across all of our functions.

You will work with our teams + stakeholders to build and maintain key data sets and dashboards, and be the go-to person when we’re looking to do deep analysis or answer thorny data-driven business decisions; you’re dogmatic in chasing down the answer, even when it isn’t easy.

Job Duties:
• Build dashboards (in Mode) and key data sets to empower stakeholders to perform their own analysis
• Work across teams to define key metrics, develop dashboards, track metric progress, investigate changes in metrics, and propose next steps
• Influence teams through presentation of data-based recommendations
• Help scale the business by turning one-off analyses (variable cost) into automated processes (fixed cost)
• Grit: you are goal-oriented, purpose-driven, and are perseverant about achieving their goals, even in the face of adversity

About you:
• 3-6 years of experience working as a data analyst, data scientist, consulting, banking, or equivalent quantitative analytical role
• Bachelor’s or advanced degree in statistics, math, economics, computer science, finance, or equivalent practical experience
• Expert SQL skills, and experience with BI tools (Mode, Tableau, Looker, Qlikview, etc.)
• Strong communication skills and the ability to explain complex analyses to both technical and non-technical audiences; you can explain your analysis to the leadership team or the BDR team, and level set appropriately
• Experience working directly with business teams to define metrics, analyze problems, and propose solutions
• Familiar with a statistical modeling language (such as Python or R)
• Are excited to dig into our business processes to understand how data is generated
• Are eager to learn new tools and improve your technical skill set
• Have empathy with our clients and internal partners
• Are comfortable with multi-stakeholder environment and context-switching
• Are willing to go above and beyond their duties
• Take initiative in problem solving and chasing down solutions
• Have experience performing business driver analysis, identifying opportunities and making recommendations to stakeholders
• 1+ years of professional experience with Python or R

Nice to have:
• Insurance or financial services background
• Exposure to and passion for early-stage startups and/or high growth environments

Vouch provides a number of benefits to help you bring your best self to work:
• Competitive compensation and equity packages
• Health, dental, and vision insurance
• Parental leave
• Flexible vacation time (Unlimited PTO)
• Wellness allowance ($80/month)
• Technology allowance ($100/month)

Salary Range:

The pay range for this role is: $120,000 to $140,000 per year.

Google's known for our innovative technologies, products and services -- and for the people behind them. Whether you are making our staffing systems more efficient, planning for our growth, building relationships on college campuses or cultivating the next generation of computer scientists, you have an eye on the staffing needs of Google and the broader hiring landscape. You are focused on cultivating outstanding candidates for Google's long-term hiring needs, and work across a cross-functional and international group of staffing teams. You are both scrappy and resourceful, creative and driven -- and excited to share the magic of working at Google.

The Online Recruiting team helps to drive Google's approach to reviewing online candidates and employee referrals for our active pipeline. Our team aims to provide our Recruiting teams with a pipeline of qualified, diverse talent for our business clients and partners.

As a Program Operations Management Analyst, you will deliver project workstreams by making key contributions, including conducting strategic analyses and translating/defining business questions into simple analyses, evaluation metrics, or statistical models. As you work within one or more teams, you'll address conflicts between the goals and objectives of stakeholders by understanding the nature of the problem and underlying assumptions. You will work with data analytics, analytical tools, statistical methods, and business contexts to analyze data. You'll advise team members in the Analyst ecosystem on their specialty areas by developing expertise within a People Operations domain.

Great just isn't good enough for our People Operations team (known elsewhere as ""Human Resources""). We bring the world's most innovative people to Google and provide the programs that help them thrive. Whether recruiting the next Googler, refining our core programs, developing talent, or simply looking for ways to inject some more fun into the lives of our Googlers, we bring a data-driven approach that is reinventing the human resources field. You’ll play an essential role advancing a more diverse, accessible, equitable, and inclusive Google through our hiring, promotion, retention, and inclusion practices.

Data Analyst,InnovateEDU,"Position Title: Data Analyst (Remote)

This opening is for a REMOTE position.

About InnovateEDU

InnovateEDU is a non-profit whose mission is to eliminate the opportunity gap by accelerating innovation in standards-aligned, next-generation learning models and tools that serve, inform, and enhance teaching and learning. InnovateEDU is committed to massively disrupting K-12 public education by focusing on the development of scalable tools and practices that leverage innovation, technology, and new human capital systems to improve education for all students and close the achievement gap.

About the Project

InnovateEDU strives to create real tooling and projects that greatly assist a school/district/state in moving toward embracing data standards, a data-driven culture, and data interoperability. Landing Zone, a project at InnovateEDU, aims to provide the best-in-class data infrastructure and support to client districts in order to transform how data is being used in the 20 (and... counting!) school systems where it is implemented. We believe supporting schools with data doesn’t just mean technology and dashboards - it means investing in the people who do the work. To that end when a school adopts Landing Zone, they get not only technical products but the ability to join a team of peers who are working and learning together as well as receive weekly coaching and support from the InnovateEDU Team.

Position:

InnovateEDU is seeking a full-time Data Analyst. This role is a little non-traditional in that its primary goal is to help the data teams that Landing Zone supports understand and make use of the Landing Zone data model. This role will be mentoring junior data analysts employed by school districts, so 2+ years experience as an analyst is a must.

The three main components of this role are the following:
• One-on-one and small group mentoring of school data analysts at school via weekly coaching sessions, check-ins, or our service desk.
• Creating and curating a set of exemplar data dashboards to expose school data to end users.
• Creating training materials and hosting webinars to build the skills of the school data analysts asynchronously or in larger groups
• Building a learning community among product users

This is a full-time position with the ability to work remotely. Landing Zone is a remote-first team and members are expected to be available during set hours in their US time zone.

Responsibilities:

Lead and manage a coaching cadence and support for client school districts.

Possible tasks include:
• Provide troubleshooting and advice for schools who need just in time support
• Provide weekly coaching and mentoring for data analysts at schools and districts throughout the country
• Create/ Revise workflow systems and procedures by monitoring and analyzing client usage, success, project tasks, and data to determine the need for implementation changes
• Provide administrative support as needed to maintain workflow
• Maintain and monitor implementation plans for schools
• Organize and participate in product meetings, especially communication around system upgrades or changes

Create dashboards and analyses on top of Landing Zone data.

Possible tasks include:
• Overhauling the base set of data dashboards that customers get when they join Landing Zone to have a consistent look and feel and use best practices for data visualization.
• Creating example SQL queries to calculate different metrics.
• Providing input on the Landing Zone data model to make it more usable for district analysts.

Curate/create a set of resources that analysts can work through independently to upskill themselves. Possible tasks include:
• Creating a scope and sequence of independent learning that we expect junior district analysts to complete.
• Finding the best online courses for learning/improving with SQL skills.
• Creating education-specific content targeted at building key skills sets
• Writing blog posts on new product features or tool capabilities.

Who You Are

You are a data maven. You have either been a data analyst yourself or worked in data for a school system. You are a natural coach. You are a mission-driven individual and believe in working to close the educational achievement gap. You are an optimistic problem-solver and believe that together we can create real solutions that help the entire sector move forward. You are keen to understand different moving pieces of a complex project and willing to use your skills to organize the work for seamless implementation. You are excited to join a growing team working on early-stage products that have long-term impacts on the sector.

You are open to feedback, bring your best every day, and are ready to grow in all areas of your work. You want to join a team of folks who share your vision for mission-driven work at the intersection of education and technology. Finally, you know that sharing often is key to this work and are ready to document everything that you do so that schools everywhere and the sector as a whole can benefit.

Experience and Skills

You are a good fit if you:
• Have 2+ years of experience in data analytics, data engineering, or a related field with a demonstrated history of project ownership and execution

Data Analyst,InnovateEDU,"Position Title: Data Analyst (Remote)

This opening is for a REMOTE position.

About InnovateEDU

InnovateEDU is a non-profit whose mission is to eliminate the opportunity gap by accelerating innovation in standards-aligned, next-generation learning models and tools that serve, inform, and enhance teaching and learning. InnovateEDU is committed to massively disrupting K-12 public education by focusing on the development of scalable tools and practices that leverage innovation, technology, and new human capital systems to improve education for all students and close the achievement gap.

About the Project

InnovateEDU strives to create real tooling and projects that greatly assist a school/district/state in moving toward embracing data standards, a data-driven culture, and data interoperability. Landing Zone, a project at InnovateEDU, aims to provide the best-in-class data infrastructure and support to client districts in order to transform how data is being used in the 20 (and... counting!) school systems where it is implemented. We believe supporting schools with data doesn’t just mean technology and dashboards - it means investing in the people who do the work. To that end when a school adopts Landing Zone, they get not only technical products but the ability to join a team of peers who are working and learning together as well as receive weekly coaching and support from the InnovateEDU Team.

Position:

InnovateEDU is seeking a full-time Data Analyst. This role is a little non-traditional in that its primary goal is to help the data teams that Landing Zone supports understand and make use of the Landing Zone data model. This role will be mentoring junior data analysts employed by school districts, so 2+ years experience as an analyst is a must.

The three main components of this role are the following:
• One-on-one and small group mentoring of school data analysts at school via weekly coaching sessions, check-ins, or our service desk.
• Creating and curating a set of exemplar data dashboards to expose school data to end users.
• Creating training materials and hosting webinars to build the skills of the school data analysts asynchronously or in larger groups
• Building a learning community among product users

This is a full-time position with the ability to work remotely. Landing Zone is a remote-first team and members are expected to be available during set hours in their US time zone.

Responsibilities:

Lead and manage a coaching cadence and support for client school districts.

Possible tasks include:
• Provide troubleshooting and advice for schools who need just in time support
• Provide weekly coaching and mentoring for data analysts at schools and districts throughout the country
• Create/ Revise workflow systems and procedures by monitoring and analyzing client usage, success, project tasks, and data to determine the need for implementation changes
• Provide administrative support as needed to maintain workflow
• Maintain and monitor implementation plans for schools
• Organize and participate in product meetings, especially communication around system upgrades or changes

Create dashboards and analyses on top of Landing Zone data.

Possible tasks include:
• Overhauling the base set of data dashboards that customers get when they join Landing Zone to have a consistent look and feel and use best practices for data visualization.
• Creating example SQL queries to calculate different metrics.
• Providing input on the Landing Zone data model to make it more usable for district analysts.

Curate/create a set of resources that analysts can work through independently to upskill themselves. Possible tasks include:
• Creating a scope and sequence of independent learning that we expect junior district analysts to complete.
• Finding the best online courses for learning/improving with SQL skills.
• Creating education-specific content targeted at building key skills sets
• Writing blog posts on new product features or tool capabilities.

Who You Are

You are a data maven. You have either been a data analyst yourself or worked in data for a school system. You are a natural coach. You are a mission-driven individual and believe in working to close the educational achievement gap. You are an optimistic problem-solver and believe that together we can create real solutions that help the entire sector move forward. You are keen to understand different moving pieces of a complex project and willing to use your skills to organize the work for seamless implementation. You are excited to join a growing team working on early-stage products that have long-term impacts on the sector.

You are open to feedback, bring your best every day, and are ready to grow in all areas of your work. You want to join a team of folks who share your vision for mission-driven work at the intersection of education and technology. Finally, you know that sharing often is key to this work and are ready to document everything that you do so that schools everywhere and the sector as a whole can benefit.

Operations Analyst,Headway,"Headway is building a new mental healthcare system that everyone can access. We make it easy for people to find quality in-network mental health care by removing historic barriers faced by mental health providers, payers, and patients.

1 in 4 people in the US have a treatable mental health condition, but the vast majority do not get the care they need. The primary reason is cost: the majority of therapists do not accept insurance, meaning paying for therapy is prohibitively expensive for prospective patients. This is where we got our start – Headway has built the first software-enabled network of therapists who accept health insurance, making it easy for therapists to grow their practices, and possible for patients to find quality care they can afford.

We launched in April of 2019 and are now powering 300,000+ appointments per month. To scale our vision, we’ve raised over $100 million in funding from a16z, Thrive, Accel, and Google Ventures.

Join us, and make an impact

About The... Role

As a member of the Network Operations team, you will play an integral role in helping our network of therapists accept insurance and begin offering sessions to clients. In this role, you will manage the credentialing process from start to finish, monitor our pipeline health, and support the overall maintenance of our network to ensure we have quality providers and clean provider data.

You will face ambiguous problems and be responsible for advancing our pipeline of therapists throughout various stages in the therapist life cycle at Headway. You will work cross-functionally with the sales, customer experience, and engineering teams to make progress within our systems. You’ll also work closely with our providers and insurance partners.

You’d be a great fit if...
• You have 1+ years experience in operations
• You have experience managing and driving projects forward independently. You’re process driven, extremely detail oriented and highly organized.
• You’re highly adaptable. You can quickly change direction to execute different functions and responsibilities with ease.
• You enjoy challenges and tackle them thoughtfully and analytically.
• You want to learn and grow. You view this role as an opportunity to learn from a talented team and are excited to take on more responsibility at Headway over time.
• You’re an excellent communicator.
• You are passionate about increasing access to mental health.

We believe a team's strength is in its people, and we cannot achieve this mission without a team that reflects the diversity of this problem - across race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, age, national origin, religion, family status, disability, military status, and experience.

Operations Analyst,Headway,"Headway is building a new mental healthcare system that everyone can access. We make it easy for people to find quality in-network mental health care by removing historic barriers faced by mental health providers, payers, and patients.

1 in 4 people in the US have a treatable mental health condition, but the vast majority do not get the care they need. The primary reason is cost: the majority of therapists do not accept insurance, meaning paying for therapy is prohibitively expensive for prospective patients. This is where we got our start – Headway has built the first software-enabled network of therapists who accept health insurance, making it easy for therapists to grow their practices, and possible for patients to find quality care they can afford.

We launched in April of 2019 and are now powering 300,000+ appointments per month. To scale our vision, we’ve raised over $100 million in funding from a16z, Thrive, Accel, and Google Ventures.

Join us, and make an impact

About The... Role

As a member of the Network Operations team, you will play an integral role in helping our network of therapists accept insurance and begin offering sessions to clients. In this role, you will manage the credentialing process from start to finish, monitor our pipeline health, and support the overall maintenance of our network to ensure we have quality providers and clean provider data.

You will face ambiguous problems and be responsible for advancing our pipeline of therapists throughout various stages in the therapist life cycle at Headway. You will work cross-functionally with the sales, customer experience, and engineering teams to make progress within our systems. You’ll also work closely with our providers and insurance partners.

You’d be a great fit if...
• You have 1+ years experience in operations
• You have experience managing and driving projects forward independently. You’re process driven, extremely detail oriented and highly organized.
• You’re highly adaptable. You can quickly change direction to execute different functions and responsibilities with ease.
• You enjoy challenges and tackle them thoughtfully and analytically.
• You want to learn and grow. You view this role as an opportunity to learn from a talented team and are excited to take on more responsibility at Headway over time.
• You’re an excellent communicator.
• You are passionate about increasing access to mental health.

We believe a team's strength is in its people, and we cannot achieve this mission without a team that reflects the diversity of this problem - across race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, age, national origin, religion, family status, disability, military status, and experience.

Headway employees work remotely across the US, with the option to work from our NYC HQ.

HOW WE LIVE OUR VALUES TO OUR TEAMMATES:

We’re seeking those with passion for healthcare and relentless devotion to our goal. We need team members that embody our following core values:

1) We are human, first
Our humanity binds us together. We bring the same empathetic approach to every individual we engage with, whether it be our members, our clients, or each other. We are all worthy of respect and understanding and we engage in our interactions with care and intention. We honor our stories. We listen to—and hear—each other, we celebrate our differences and similarities, we are present for each other, and we strive for mutual understanding.

2) We redefine what is possible
We always look beyond the obstacles in front of us to imagine new solutions. We approach our work with inspiration from other industries, other leaders, and other challenges. We use ingenuity and resourcefulness when faced with tough problems.

3) We debate then commit
We believe that a spirit of open discourse is part of a healthy culture. We understand and appreciate different perspectives and we challenge our assumptions. When working toward a decision or a new solution, we actively listen to one another, approach it with a “yes, and” mentality, and assume positive intent. Once a decision is made, we align and champion it as one team.

4) We cultivate grit
Changing healthcare doesn’t happen overnight. We reflect and learn from challenges and approach the future with a determination to strive for better. In the face of daunting situations, we value persistence. We embrace failure as a stepping stone to future success. On this journey, we seek to act with guts, resilience, initiative, and tenacity.

5) We seek to delight
Healthcare is complicated and personal. We work tirelessly to meet the goals of our clients while also delivering the best experience to our members. We recognize that no matter the role or team, we each play a crucial part in our members’ care and take that responsibility seriously. When faced with an obstacle, we are kind, respectful, and solution-oriented in our approach. We hold ourselves accountable to our clients and our members’ success.

Rightway is a healthcare company looking to improve healthcare outcomes for everyone, everywhere. With that in mind, we have to consider what is good for the health of our team, the company, and the communities we operate in. As such, Rightway has determined a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policy for all employees, in combination with other safety precautions, is the best way forward.

Data Analyst,Tasman Analytics,"Tasman is defining the future of Data Science As A Service. We are a young, fast-growing company funded fully by analytics & data science work for our ambitious clients.

We are hiring a Data Analyst to join our team and help us:
• Leverage our growing data platform to provide fast, accurate insights to key business questions
• Work with our clients to deliver in-depth analysis that solves business challenges and enables data-informed decisions
• Design and build dashboards that clients can use to self-serve analysis and track key metrics
• Be one of the key points of contact with our clients and work closely with analytics engineers and data scientists to ensure what we build delivers business value.

ABOUT TASMAN

Tasman helps fast-growing companies build out a best-in-class data platform and team.

We work with companies of all sizes, stages (from pre-series A to post-IPO), industries, and business models (e.g. ecommerce, B2C subscription, B2B SaaS, etc). Past clients include... well-known brands like Asana Rebel, Canon, Ecosia, Kaia Health, and Pensionbee. What they all have in common is a desire to use data to improve their decision making. This is also what drives us: we deliver the people, platform, and processes to make that possible.

We do this by operating as an interim data team for our clients—occasionally alongside an existing data team—always with the goal of fully handing over to an internal data team by the end of the project. We leverage our combined experience in data strategy, business analysis, data engineering, analytics engineering, data analytics, and data science to deliver meaningful insights to the business and set their internal data team up for long-term success.

Tasman was founded in 2017 and has since grown to a team of 15 across three countries: the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Sweden. We expect to double in size in 2022 as we take on an increasing number of clients. We are a profitable business and have not taken outside investment—our growth is fully funded by the revenue from client work.

The work environment at Tasman

We are a remote and distributed team: we give everyone the flexibility to work from home, a co-working space of their choice, or one of our offices. We trust our team and understand that life sometimes happens in between work.

Moreover, we want to create an environment where people of all ages, identities, and backgrounds can thrive and achieve meaningful and sustainable growth. We take a people-first approach that promotes work-life balance alongside physical and mental well-being, because we understand that investing in the long-term health and success of our team members achieves the best outcomes for everyone involved.

As a small company, we are still a work in progress. We are working to craft a culture and workplace where people who love data are able to do their best work. We therefore welcome feedback on everything we do: from hiring and onboarding, to how we work and communicate, and how we most effectively deliver value to our clients.

YOU & THE ROLE

You will:
• Help our clients to solve real business challenges that have a measurable impact on their success.
• Develop comprehensive, articulate business analysis documents that ensure successful delivery.
• Run rapid analysis leveraging a growing and scalable platform for data science and analytics
• Build sophisticated, user-friendly data dashboards that allow self-serve analytics
• Contribute to client data strategy across different business domains
• Work in close collaboration with the other teams at Tasman to design and develop a consistent data layer
• Expand and improve the suite of tools that form the foundation of all the client work we do.
• Get to work with an experienced team. Coaching and mentoring is an important part of the road to success for us.
• Have the opportunity to become an expert on data analysis. You will develop strong opinions, whilst retaining a certain level of pragmatism, and you will have the opportunity to share those opinions by writing blog posts and presenting at conferences.
• Work closely with internal data teams at our clients to ensure a smooth handover as we near the end of a project.

You are someone who:
• Is self-motivated and has a can-do attitude to learning new skills and tools.
• Is a good communicator and able to work directly with other functions in a business.
• Is comfortable explaining their thinking and discussing different approaches to a problem.
• Likes working collaboratively and creatively to identify new solutions.
• Cares about the details and understands the importance of documentation and process.
• Takes security seriously.
• Knows how to balance competing priorities.
• Understands the importance of planning and estimating work.
• Likes working on multiple problems for multiple clients at any given time.
• Cares about creating an inclusive and diverse environment.
• Thrives in a remote-first, distributed work environment.

To succeed in this role:
• You have practical experience in one or more business domains, such as marketing, product, retail, CPG, apps, or ecommerce and understand how business value is realised in those domains.
• You have a strong understanding of consumer-facing businesses and customer behaviour.
• You have a strong analytical mindset and experience with using data to solve problems and find answers to complex questions.
• You have at least two years of relevant experience. You won’t know how all the systems work on day one so we don’t expect you to hit the ground running, but a good understanding of the fundamentals and experience working in a similar role will help you get up to speed quickly.
• You might have a STEM degree. You might not. That’s not necessarily what we’re looking for. We care about what you can do and how you do it, not about how you got here. A strong track record of conscientious, thoughtful work speaks volumes.

You will work as a data analyst in one of our two delivery squads. Each squad works with between four and six clients at any time and is responsible for the end-to-end delivery of the data project for those clients. They are multidisciplinary teams so you can expect to work closely with—and learn from—data engineers, analytics engineers, data scientists, and the heads of data and engineering. By contributing to end-to-end solutions for a variety of clients, you will be able to hone both your technical and analytical skills, and your business acumen.

Read more about the job (and a lot of background on our Business Analysis principles) in our blog post, which you can find over here.

APPLICATION PROCESS

We understand that interviewing for a new role can be time consuming and, occasionally, frustrating. We will be respectful of your time and inform you of our decision as soon as we have made it. We aim to run an inclusive process so if reasonable accommodations are needed to participate in our job application process, please let us know.

This is what you can expect from the application process:
• Application. You will be asked to submit a resume and answer a few questions, which help us understand how your background and interests fit with what we are looking for at Tasman. Make sure to answer these questions carefully as they can make the difference between a successful application and not.
• Short introductory call. We will schedule a brief call with the hiring manager for this role to discuss your background and interests and to give you the opportunity to learn more about Tasman.
• Team interview. This step in the application process is a one-hour interview with two senior analysts. Their questions will focus on culture fit and broader business understanding. You will, of course, get to ask them plenty of questions too to learn more about what it’s like to work for Tasman.
• Analytical task. You will be asked to work on a set of problems that reflect the technical, analytical and communication skills needed for this role. It gives us a sense of your skills and it hopefully also gives you a taste of what it’s like working for Tasman. We will give you personal feedback on this task, regardless of the outcome.
• Final interview. This is the final step in the application process and consists of a one-hour interview with the hiring manager and a senior engineer on the team. We will discuss the task (and give you feedback) but also cover a wider set of questions around your business experience and your outlook for the role.
• Decision. We will let you know our decision and, if we make you an offer, we will give you the opportunity to talk to others on our team to support you in making your decision.

The hiring manager for this role is Rob Hick, Head of Data Strategy.

We process and interview candidates on an ongoing basis. If you have any questions about the role or the process, feel free to contact us at recruiting@tasman.ai. Note that we are an English-speaking company so we look for the ability to communicate with clarity and precision in English—both verbally and in writing.

We look forward to hearing from you",via Outer Join,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,0,2023-03-08 13:07:51,https://outerjoin.us/remote-jobs/data-analyst-at-tasman-analytics?utm_campaign=google_jobs_apply&utm_source=google_jobs_apply&utm_medium=organic,,,,,,,,,"We are hiring a Data Analyst to join our team and help us: • Leverage our growing data platform to provide fast, accurate insights to key business questions • Work with our clients to deliver in-depth analysis that solves business challenges and enables data-informed decisions • Design and build dashboards that clients can use to self-serve analysis and track key metrics • Be one of the key points of contact with our clients and work closely with analytics engineers and data scientists to ensure what we build delivers business value.

• Experience with databases (SQL)
• Hybrid remote and on-site

• You care about improving the state of renewable energy; you'd love to make geothermal heating and cooling accessible to homeowners everywhere
• Experience with the following is a plus although not a must: databases (BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift) and writing SQL, data visualization tools (Tableau, Looker, PowerBi), familiarity with ingestion tools (FiveTran) and/or transformation tools (dbt)

Benefits/Perks:
• Health/Dental/Vision insurance
• 401k plan
• Stock/Equity options
• Paid Sick and Vacation time (PTO)
• Training support (on-the-job and/or virtual)

You'll love working at Dandelion because:

We're solving the world's hardest problems. You'll have the opportunity to pioneer renewable heating and cooling from the ground-up (literally). There's no established playbook for fighting climate change, so your work will be messy, challenging, and build a better, cleaner world.

We're good people. It sounds simple, and it is. We are passionate, vision-driven, low-ego, and treat one another with kindness and respect. We challenge ideas here, not people.

We hold each other accountable. We celebrate our wins and learn from our losses. We're honest, realistic, and transparent across all areas of the business, every day -- not just at our monthly all-hands meeting.

Since spinning out of Google X in 2017, Dandelion Energy has been an energy innovation company working to electrify home heating. We create and install geothermal heat pumps to replace fossil-fueled furnaces and boilers. We've grown into an organization of over 100 employees and have become the largest residential geothermal heat pump installation company in the United States. Our carbon impact to date is the equivalent to taking over 25,000 cars off the road... and that impact is accelerating with our growth!

• Do you want to help operate a successful, growing services business?

If you answered yes to the above, then the Operations Analyst role may be a good fit for you. You will play an active role in running business operations for the VMware Tanzu Labs Platform Services Delivery team in the Americas. You will help operationalize our book of business, ensuring we achieve positive customer outcomes and business success by optimizing people allocations on customer engagements.

Success in the Role: What are the performance goals over the first 6-12 months you will work towards completing?

We need someone who is a relentless problem solver. You'll be coached and mentored by supportive teammates every step of the way to achieve the following:
• You will monitor and understand the sales pipeline in order to anticipate staffing requirements and timelines
• You will be responsible for staffing customer projects to ensure customer needs are met and optimal billable utilization achieved across the team
• You will collaborate with Delivery Leaders, People Managers and Delivery Operations to achieve quarterly and annual objectives and key results

What type of work will you be doing? What assignments, requirements, or skills will you be performing on a regular basis?

As a member of the VMware Tanzu Labs Platform Services Delivery Operations Team, you will drive staffing solutions that maximize customer experience and business performance. Your work will include:

Sales Operations Analyst (Remote),Samsara,"Who we are

Samsara (NYSE: IOT) is the pioneer of the Connected Operations Cloud, which helps to digitize the world of physical operations, providing visibility and empowering entire sectors of our economy to become more safe, efficient, and sustainable. Founded in San Francisco in 2015, we now employ more than 2,000 people globally and collect more than 40 billion minutes of video footage and 5... trillion data points annually.

Working at Samsara means you’ll help define the future of physical operations and be on a team that’s shaping an exciting array of product solutions, including video-based safety, vehicle telematics, apps and driver workflows, equipment monitoring, and site visibility. As part of a newly public company, you’ll have the autonomy and support to make an impact as we build for the long term.

Recent awards we’ve won include:

Best Place to Work by Built In 2022

Deloitte Fast 500 Companies

IoT Analytics Company of the Year in 2022’s IoT Breakthrough Winners

Every year, we partner with our customers to deliver outcomes like conserving millions of gallons of fuel, saving millions of dollars, and creating positive environmental change. As more customers connect to our platform, our data grows, our AI models get smarter, and our opportunities expand.

About the role:

Samsara is looking for a smart, ambitious Sales Operations Analyst interested in helping to ensure the success of our global sales organization. We are seeking people with a passion for helping others, who are eager to work in a fast-paced, dynamic environment and have a direct impact on our growth and the success of our global sales org as we build out our team in Mexico. Proven problem-solving and communication skills as well as fluency in English and Spanish are required.

You should apply if:
• You want to impact the industries that run our world: Your efforts will result in real-world impact—helping to keep the lights on, get food into grocery stores, and most importantly, ensure workers return home safely.
• You have innate curiosity in how businesses work: One day you’ll meet with someone in waste management and the next you may be learning about the inner workings of a food distribution center. Our top sales team members seek to learn the ins and outs of the businesses they support in order to make a larger impact.
• You build genuine relationships with your customers: The industries we serve have relied on pen-and-paper solutions for years and haven’t been met with the type of technology we offer. Our customers value earned trust and human relationships built over time.
• You want to be with the best: Samsara’s high-performance culture means you’ll be surrounded by the best and challenged to go farther than you have before.
• You are a team player: At Samsara, sales is a team sport. We help each other out by sharing best practices and focus on winning as a team.

Click here to learn about what we value at Samsara.
In this role, you will:
• Provide comprehensive operational support to the sales organization, including but not limited to account and opportunity management, and support case responses
• Solve time-sensitive sales pain points in the moment to get deals across the line
• Own enforcement of sales processes and policies
• Work cross-functionally with internal stakeholders to support sales deals
• Help administer sales tools, including Salesforce
• Champion, role model, and embed Samsara’s cultural principles (Focus on Customer Success, Build for the Long Term, Adopt a Growth Mindset, Be Inclusive, Win as a Team) as we scale globally and across new offices

Minimum requirements for the role:
• Fluent (speaking, reading, writing) in both English and Spanish
• Problem solving and analytical skills
• Attention to detail
• Comfort working under time pressure
• Can quickly adapt to changes in the workplace environment
• Ability to multitask and organize multiple priorities at once
• Strong written and verbal communication skills

An ideal candidate also has:
• 1+ years of previous Sales Support, or equivalent, experience
• 1+ years working with Salesforce
• Bachelor’s Degree

At Samsara, we welcome everyone regardless of their background, race, national origin, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, protected veteran status, disability, age, etc. We depend on the unique approaches of our team members to help us solve complex problems. We are committed to increasing diversity across our team and ensuring that Samsara is a place where people from all backgrounds can make an impact.

Accommodations

Samsara is an inclusive work environment, and we are committed to ensuring equal opportunity in employment for qualified persons with disabilities. Please email accessibleinterviewing@samsara.com or click here if you require any reasonable accommodations throughout the recruiting process.

US Only: Please note that Samsara’s COVID-19 vaccination policy requires all team members who will be meeting in person for business or working from one of our offices to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or submit regular testing. People who cannot be vaccinated for qualifying medical conditions, sincerely held religious beliefs, and other legally protected categories, may request an accommodation.

Benefits

Full time employees receive an above market total compensation package along with employee-led remote and flexible working, health benefits, Samsara for Good charity fund, and much, much more. Take a look at our Benefits site to learn more.

Flexible Working

At Samsara, we have adopted a flexible way of working, enabling teams and individuals to do their best work, regardless of where they’re based. We value in-person collaboration and know a change of scenery and quiet space to work is welcomed from time to time, but also appreciate that the world of work has changed. Our offices remain open for those who prefer to collaborate or work in-office, but we also encourage fully remote applicants. As most roles are not required to be in the office, we are able to hire remotely where Samsara has an established presence. If a role is required to be in a certain location and candidates do not have work authorization for that location, Samsara will conduct an immigration assessment. If the role is not required to be in a specific location, Samsara will move forward with the remote location that works best for the business. All offers of employment are contingent upon an individual’s ability to secure and maintain the legal right to work at the company.

Please note: Samsara does not accept agency resumes and is not responsible for any fees related to unsolicited resumes. Please do not forward resumes to Samsara employees",via Built In San Francisco,eyJqb2JfdGl0bGUiOiJTYWxlcyBPcGVyYXRpb25zIEFuYWx5c3QgKFJlbW90ZSkiLCJodGlkb2NpZCI6IkNzUFVjYlhDTDBVQUFBQUFBQUFBQUE9PSIsInV1bGUiOiJ3K0NBSVFJQ0lOVlc1cGRHVmtJRk4wWVhSbGN3IiwiZ2wiOiJ1cyIsImhsIjoiZW4iLCJmYyI6IkVvc0NDc3dCUVVOUWQycHFWR1p6VVZoUFgwTTBNV1V5T1d0QldrcHJUV1ZaZDFkWE9WbDBWbkUyTlROTlFWbDRZVkEyZUZweFEwaFVhR2xrZVdWaFRYQnJPSEpZVlhNMVNGbHlSME5uY2tScE1EQlZTMDl1TjBoa2MxZFhRMWQ0VFVGb1kxRnpOMDV5WTJoa05VNXNVakJuWVZWellraDZPR05RZDFSVFkxaE9ObFIyUlZnMFJYcG5XbDgwV2xGaWJscE9VRTVzTXpSTGIwbEtjRUp2WmtGaGIyZEVXRXRCYzBFNFFWcElkblZyYWkxVFVrOUZkVEZGU3poV1VrRmxUSEZxWVVkYVJqaHZhRXRITjBsQlUydG9FaFozT1hkSldsQlVTa0Z3WmxGclVFbFFNemxQVUVOQkdpSkJSbDgyVFVGTldHczJNakJqY2pKVGRGbzVaREkwY21kVFQxUk1VbnBxUkY5QiIsImZjdiI6IjMiLCJmY19pZCI6ImZjXzE3IiwiYXBwbHlfbGluayI6eyJ0aXRsZSI6IkFwcGx5IG9uIEJ1aWx0IEluIFNhbiBGcmFuY2lzY28iLCJsaW5rIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVpbHRpbnNmLmNvbS9qb2Ivc2FsZXMvc2FsZXMtb3BlcmF0aW9ucy1hbmFseXN0LzE0MTQyMD91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249Z29vZ2xlX2pvYnNfYXBwbHlcdTAwMjZ1dG1fc291cmNlPWdvb2dsZV9qb2JzX2FwcGx5XHUwMDI2dXRtX21lZGl1bT1vcmdhbmljIn19,216,2023-03-08 13:07:00,https://www.builtinsf.com/job/sales/sales-operations-analyst/141420?utm_campaign=google_jobs_apply&utm_source=google_jobs_apply&utm_medium=organic,4.3,757.0,Glassdoor,Based on local employers,78000.0,150000.0,Talent.com,,"Who we are We are seeking people with a passion for helping others, who are eager to work in a fast-paced, dynamic environment and have a direct impact on our growth and the success of our global sales org as we build out our team in Mexico.

Sales Operations Analyst (Remote),Samsara,"Who we are

Samsara (NYSE: IOT) is the pioneer of the Connected Operations Cloud, which helps to digitize the world of physical operations, providing visibility and empowering entire sectors of our economy to become more safe, efficient, and sustainable. Founded in San Francisco in 2015, we now employ more than 2,000 people globally and collect more than 40 billion minutes of video footage and 5... trillion data points annually.

Working at Samsara means you’ll help define the future of physical operations and be on a team that’s shaping an exciting array of product solutions, including video-based safety, vehicle telematics, apps and driver workflows, equipment monitoring, and site visibility. As part of a newly public company, you’ll have the autonomy and support to make an impact as we build for the long term.

Recent awards we’ve won include:

Best Place to Work by Built In 2022

Deloitte Fast 500 Companies

IoT Analytics Company of the Year in 2022’s IoT Breakthrough Winners

Every year, we partner with our customers to deliver outcomes like conserving millions of gallons of fuel, saving millions of dollars, and creating positive environmental change. As more customers connect to our platform, our data grows, our AI models get smarter, and our opportunities expand.

About the role:

Samsara is looking for a smart, ambitious Sales Operations Analyst interested in helping to ensure the success of our global sales organization. We are seeking people with a passion for helping others, who are eager to work in a fast-paced, dynamic environment and have a direct impact on our growth and the success of our global sales org as we build out our team in Mexico. Proven problem-solving and communication skills as well as fluency in English and Spanish are required.

You should apply if:
• You want to impact the industries that run our world: Your efforts will result in real-world impact—helping to keep the lights on, get food into grocery stores, and most importantly, ensure workers return home safely.
• You have innate curiosity in how businesses work: One day you’ll meet with someone in waste management and the next you may be learning about the inner workings of a food distribution center. Our top sales team members seek to learn the ins and outs of the businesses they support in order to make a larger impact.
• You build genuine relationships with your customers: The industries we serve have relied on pen-and-paper solutions for years and haven’t been met with the type of technology we offer. Our customers value earned trust and human relationships built over time.
• You want to be with the best: Samsara’s high-performance culture means you’ll be surrounded by the best and challenged to go farther than you have before.
• You are a team player: At Samsara, sales is a team sport. We help each other out by sharing best practices and focus on winning as a team.

Click here to learn about what we value at Samsara.
In this role, you will:
• Provide comprehensive operational support to the sales organization, including but not limited to account and opportunity management, and support case responses
• Solve time-sensitive sales pain points in the moment to get deals across the line
• Own enforcement of sales processes and policies
• Work cross-functionally with internal stakeholders to support sales deals
• Help administer sales tools, including Salesforce
• Champion, role model, and embed Samsara’s cultural principles (Focus on Customer Success, Build for the Long Term, Adopt a Growth Mindset, Be Inclusive, Win as a Team) as we scale globally and across new offices

Minimum requirements for the role:
• Fluent (speaking, reading, writing) in both English and Spanish
• Problem solving and analytical skills
• Attention to detail
• Comfort working under time pressure
• Can quickly adapt to changes in the workplace environment
• Ability to multitask and organize multiple priorities at once
• Strong written and verbal communication skills

An ideal candidate also has:
• 1+ years of previous Sales Support, or equivalent, experience
• 1+ years working with Salesforce
• Bachelor’s Degree

At Samsara, we welcome everyone regardless of their background, race, national origin, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, protected veteran status, disability, age, etc. We depend on the unique approaches of our team members to help us solve complex problems. We are committed to increasing diversity across our team and ensuring that Samsara is a place where people from all backgrounds can make an impact.

Accommodations

Samsara is an inclusive work environment, and we are committed to ensuring equal opportunity in employment for qualified persons with disabilities. Please email accessibleinterviewing@samsara.com or click here if you require any reasonable accommodations throughout the recruiting process.

US Only: Please note that Samsara’s COVID-19 vaccination policy requires all team members who will be meeting in person for business or working from one of our offices to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or submit regular testing. People who cannot be vaccinated for qualifying medical conditions, sincerely held religious beliefs, and other legally protected categories, may request an accommodation.

Flexible Working

At Samsara, we have adopted a flexible way of working, enabling teams and individuals to do their best work, regardless of where they’re based. We value in-person collaboration and know a change of scenery and quiet space to work is welcomed from time to time, but also appreciate that the world of work has changed. Our offices remain open for those who prefer to collaborate or work in-office, but we also encourage fully remote applicants. As most roles are not required to be in the office, we are able to hire remotely where Samsara has an established presence. If a role is required to be in a certain location and candidates do not have work authorization for that location, Samsara will conduct an immigration assessment. If the role is not required to be in a specific location, Samsara will move forward with the remote location that works best for the business. All offers of employment are contingent upon an individual’s ability to secure and maintain the legal right to work at the company.

Please note: Samsara does not accept agency resumes and is not responsible for any fees related to unsolicited resumes. Please do not forward resumes to Samsara employees",via Built In San Francisco,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,216,2023-03-08 13:07:00,https://www.builtinsf.com/job/sales/sales-operations-analyst/141420?utm_campaign=google_jobs_apply&utm_source=google_jobs_apply&utm_medium=organic,4.3,757.0,Glassdoor,Based on local employers,78000.0,150000.0,Talent.com,,"Who we are We are seeking people with a passion for helping others, who are eager to work in a fast-paced, dynamic environment and have a direct impact on our growth and the success of our global sales org as we build out our team in Mexico.

Salary offers are based on a wide range of factors including relevant skills, training, experience, education, and, where applicable, licensure or certifications obtained. Market and organizational factors are also considered. In addition to base salary and a competitive benefits package, successful candidates are eligible to receive a discretionary bonus.

MMIT is an equal opportunities employer and does not discriminate on the grounds of gender, sexual orientation, marital or civil partner status, pregnancy or maternity, gender reassignment, race, color, nationality, ethnic or national origin, religion or belief, disability or age. Our ethos is to respect and value people’s differences, to help everyone achieve more at work as well as in their personal lives so that they feel proud of the part they play in our success. We believe that all decisions about people at work should be based on the individual’s abilities, skills, performance and behavior and our business requirements. MMIT operates a zero tolerance policy to any form of discrimination, abuse or harassment.

Sometimes the best opportunities are hidden by self-doubt. We disqualify ourselves before we have the opportunity to be considered.

Operations Analyst,Headway.co,"Headway is building a new mental healthcare system that everyone can access. We make it easy for people to find quality in-network mental health care by removing historic barriers faced by mental health providers, payers, and patients.

1 in 4 people in the US have a treatable mental health condition, but the vast majority do not get the care they need. The primary reason is cost: the majority of... therapists do not accept insurance, meaning paying for therapy is prohibitively expensive for prospective patients. This is where we got our start – Headway has built the first software-enabled network of therapists who accept health insurance, making it easy for therapists to grow their practices, and possible for patients to find quality care they can afford.

We launched in April of 2019 and are now powering 300,000+ appointments per month. To scale our vision, we’ve raised over $100 million in funding from a16z, Thrive, Accel, and Google Ventures.

Join us, and make an impact

About The Role

As a member of the Network Operations team, you will play an integral role in helping our network of therapists accept insurance and begin offering sessions to clients. In this role, you will manage the credentialing process from start to finish, monitor our pipeline health, and support the overall maintenance of our network to ensure we have quality providers and clean provider data.

You will face ambiguous problems and be responsible for advancing our pipeline of therapists throughout various stages in the therapist life cycle at Headway. You will work cross-functionally with the sales, customer experience, and engineering teams to make progress within our systems. You’ll also work closely with our providers and insurance partners.

You’d be a great fit if...
• You have 1+ years experience in operations
• You have experience managing and driving projects forward independently. You’re process driven, extremely detail oriented and highly organized.
• You’re highly adaptable. You can quickly change direction to execute different functions and responsibilities with ease.
• You enjoy challenges and tackle them thoughtfully and analytically.
• You want to learn and grow. You view this role as an opportunity to learn from a talented team and are excited to take on more responsibility at Headway over time.
• You’re an excellent communicator.
• You are passionate about increasing access to mental health.

We believe a team's strength is in its people, and we cannot achieve this mission without a team that reflects the diversity of this problem - across race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, age, national origin, religion, family status, disability, military status, and experience.

Headway employees work remotely across the US, with the option to work from our NYC HQ.

Headway is committed to the full inclusion of all qualified individuals. As part of this commitment, Headway will ensure that persons with disabilities are provided with reasonable accommodations. If reasonable accommodation is needed to participate in the job application or interview process, to perform essential job functions, and/or to receive other benefits and privileges of employment, please contact talent@findheadway.com",via Glassdoor,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,384,2023-03-08 13:07:00,"https://www.glassdoor.com/job-listing/operations-analyst-headway-ny-JV_KO0,18_KE19,29.htm?jl=1008225267926&utm_campaign=google_jobs_apply&utm_source=google_jobs_apply&utm_medium=organic",,,,Based on local employers,43000.0,93000.0,Glassdoor,,"1 in 4 people in the US have a treatable mental health condition, but the vast majority do not get the care they need.

Senior Data Analyst (Remote),Flex,"Flex is an early-stage, remote-first FinTech startup that is creating the best rent payment experience. It’s hard to believe that it’s 2023 and paying rent on time is expensive, inflexible, and difficult. We’re here to change that! We enable our users to pay rent throughout the month on a schedule that better fits their finances and budget. Our mission is to empower as many renters as possible... with flexibility over their most significant recurring expense. After deliberately keeping a stealth profile as we built up unprecedented investor support and an enthusiastic user base, we are looking for motivated individuals to help us keep our mission growing in 2023. Will you be a part of the team?

The Analytics team at Flex is responsible for using data to provide visibility into business performance, deliver insights, and help drive Flex’s strategy. As a Senior Analyst, you’ll partner closely with teams & leadership across the organization to create analytics roadmaps, identify opportunities for growth, and drive a deeper understanding of our business.

What you’ll do:
• Drive impact via insights: As a resident expert of all things data at Flex, you’ll deliver business insights and illuminate trends that lead directly to operational and product improvements. You’ll directly contribute to shaping strategic decisions and driving business growth and customer engagement & satisfaction
• Define priorities: You’ll be a trusted thought-partner of our business stakeholders and relied on to determine the most impactful analytics projects
• Direct cross-departmental collaboration: You’ll work with departments across the company and connect the dots to optimize customer experience and business performance
• Democratize data: Support goal-setting across Flex by defining KPIs and setting OKR targets. You’ll create dashboards to monitor KPIs to ensure teams are making intelligent and informed decisions

What you’ll bring:
• 3+ years of analytics experience, with advanced SQL & BI tool (ideally Tableau) skills. DBT experience is a plus
• Ability to solve big-picture problems: You proactively identify areas of opportunity and analyses needed by the business
• Radical ownership: You’re a driver - you use your technical skills, business understanding, and stakeholder relationships to independently manage a large scope of work with high impact on business decisions
• Great communication skills: You can synthesize complex concepts and analyses into simple, digestible bullets than can be understood by anyone
• Comfort in uncertainty: You don’t mind spending time in the weeds turning raw data into insights. You aren’t afraid to ask questions and do the necessary research when presented with an open-ended question
• Boundless curiosity: You are always asking “why” and use data to answer those questions. You use those findings to make recommendations on how to best grow the business and help drive decision-making
• Passion for analytics: You are constantly looking for ways to utilize Tableau and advanced SQL to tackle complex business problems
Life at Flex:We understand that it takes a diverse team of highly intelligent, curious, determined, empathetic, and self aware people to grow a successful company. Our HQ is located in New York City, but we are remote-friendly with employees located throughout the US, Australia, Brazil, and Israel. We are growing quickly, but deliberately, with a focus on building an inclusive culture. Our dynamic team has incredible perspectives to share, just as we know you do, and we take great pride in being an equal opportunity workplace.
